                    <p>Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made red velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commerical kitchen in oakland, I left to grab some lunch at nearby bakery.</p>
                   
                    <p> I saw absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! Heaven by the spoonful!" </p>
